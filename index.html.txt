                can be bery effective in minimizingaccident death toll. 
                Drivers fatigue is one of the major causes of traffic 
                accidents,particularly for drivers of large vehicles
                (such as buses and heavy trucks)due to prolonged driving
                in working conditions. This project detects the signs of 
                fatigue and sleepiness in the face of the person at the 
                time of driving in this model, the person's face is filmed 
                by a camera in the first step by receiving video sequence, 
                the level of drowsiness is detected.</h3>
